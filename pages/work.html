		<p>During the 3 Months I was in the Web Development Immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly, we were given four projects to complete.</p>

			<h3>Blackjack</h3>

			<p>Our first assignment at General Assembly was to make a Blackjack app using <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>. I decided to go beyond that. I taught myself <b>Firebase</b>, then added online multiplayer functionality and chat.</p>

			<p>Our second assignment at General Assembly was to make a Forum using <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Express</b>. I decided to incorporate <b>WebRTC</b> and create a webapp which allows users to make requests for creative content, and allows other users to fill those requests via webcam audio or video recording as well as image uploads.</p>

			<h3>SOS NOW</h3>

			<p>Our third assignment at General Assembly was to make a <b>Rails</b> webapp. I worked as part of a three person team to create a post-disaster rescue app which would allow someone to submit information and their geolocated position to a database, to assist rescuers. The app also sends out a tweet with information. </p>

			<h3>Workout Tracker</h3>

			<p>For my final assignment at General Assembly, I decided I wanted to learn the rest of the MEAN Stack. So I taught myself <b>Mongo</b> (with <b>Mongoose</b>) and <b>Angular</b>, and I built a simple app which allows a user to plan and track their workouts.</p>

			<p>I wanted a simple, clean app to give me the hourly weather forecast for the next 24 hours. I also wanted to play with the forecast.io API. So I made this.</p>
