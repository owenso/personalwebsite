			<p>Our third assignment at General Assembly was to make a <b>Rails</b> webapp. I worked as part of a three person team to create a post-disaster rescue app which would allow someone to submit information and their geolocated position to a database, to assist rescuers. The app also sends out a tweet with information. </p>
